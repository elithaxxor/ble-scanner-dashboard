# Proposed Enhancements

The following ideas could further improve the BLE Scanner Suite:

- **Map visualisation** – plot device sightings on an interactive map using GeoPy and Leaflet.
- **Machine learning insights** – classify devices by behaviour patterns with scikit-learn.
- **Distributed aggregation** – combine results from multiple scanners into one dashboard.
- **Docker packaging** – provide an official container image for simplified deployment.
- **Plugin marketplace** – allow community plugins to be discovered and installed via the CLI.
- **Aggregator CLI** – fetch and merge device lists from remote dashboards.
- **Graph relationships** – visualise interactions between nearby devices.
- **Encrypted MQTT support** – secure message transport with TLS.
- **HID injection support** – replay captured keystrokes over BLE using the new active toolkit.
- **Protocol radar graphs** – visualise protocol usage in real time within the dashboard.
- **Pcap analytics** – integrate pyshark-based decoders to replay traffic and
  generate statistics about packet types and signal strength trends.
