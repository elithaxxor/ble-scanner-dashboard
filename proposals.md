# Proposed Enhancements

The following ideas could further improve the BLE Scanner Suite:

- **Map visualisation** – plot device sightings on an interactive map using GeoPy and Leaflet.
- **Machine learning insights** – classify devices by behaviour patterns with scikit-learn.
- **Distributed aggregation** – combine results from multiple scanners into one dashboard.
- **Docker packaging** – provide an official container image for simplified deployment.
- **Plugin marketplace** – allow community plugins to be discovered and installed via the CLI.
