# Additional Feature Proposals

The following ideas would further enhance the BLE Scanner Suite:

- **Remote firmware updates** – push firmware images to connected BLE devices directly from the dashboard.
- **Custom alert rules** – allow users to create alert conditions using a simple rule editor.
- **Power usage tracking** – estimate energy consumption for long‑term device monitoring.
- **Auto‑generated reports** – schedule summary reports of detected devices and activity trends.
- **Geo‑fencing** – trigger notifications when devices appear outside user‑defined zones.
